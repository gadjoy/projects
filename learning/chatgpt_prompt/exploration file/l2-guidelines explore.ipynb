    "## Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions\n",
    "### 1.Guidelines for Effective Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Clear:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Instead of saying \"Summarize this text,\" say \"Summarize the text below into one sentence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Allow Thinking Time:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Rather than immediately asking a question, provide the model with preliminary steps first to allow it time for processing and response generation..\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Tactics for Effective Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Delimiters:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Use three backticks to limit the text that needs summarizing and specify the model accordingly..\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask for Structured Output:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Ask the model to generate a list of book titles along with their authors and genres, formatted as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check Conditions:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Provide a set of instructions and ask the model to rewrite them in a specific format only if the text contains a sequence of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Few-shot\" Prompting:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Present a dialogue between a child and a grandparent, and instruct the model to respond consistently in a similar style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle 2: Give the model time to “think” \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task \n",
    "  - *Example 1:* This prompt instructs the model to summarize a provided text in one sentence, translate the summary into Arabic, list each name mentioned in the French summary, and output the results in a JSON object.\n",
    "  #### Ask for output in a specified format\n",
    "  - *Example 1:* This prompt instructs the model to summarize a given text enclosed in angle brackets, translate the summary into Arabic, list the names mentioned in the French summary, and output the information in a JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion\n",
    "  - *Example 1:* This prompt instructs the model to evaluate a student's solution to a financial problem related to building a solar power installation. The model should first work out its own solution and then compare it to the student's solution to determine its correctness.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Example 2:* Your task is to determine if the student's solution is correct or not.\n",
    "To solve the problem do the following:\n",
    "- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. \n",
    "- Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. \n",
    "Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Model Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hallucinations:**\n",
    "  - *Example:* Asking the model about a fictional product, which may result in invented details.\n"
