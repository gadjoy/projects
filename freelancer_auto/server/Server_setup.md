# Server Setup on Linux

Setting up a server on Linux. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):

   Ensure Python is installed on your Linux machine. You can install it using your package manager or by downloading it from the official Python website.

2. **Create a Server Script**:

    - Open your preferred text editor.
    - Create a new file named `app.py`.
    - Write your server code in `app.py`. This could be a Flask application, a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server` module, or any other server script according to your requirements.

3. **Run the Server**:

    - Open a terminal window.
    - Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
    - Execute the following command to run the server:

      ```bash
      python3 app.py
      ```

4. **Access the Server**:

    - Once the server is running, open a web browser.
    - Navigate to [http://localhost:8000] or the appropriate address and port specified by your server script.

That's it! You now have a server running on your Linux machine. You can use it to serve files locally or handle HTTP requests as per your requirements. Feel free to modify the server script (`app.py`) to suit your needs.
