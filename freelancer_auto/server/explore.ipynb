      "This project proposes to modify the code of a Python program to replace OpenAI by Fireworks.ai (Llama 3 70B Instruct). The modified code will be used for a realtime AI Phone Agent made on Vapi.ai.\n",
      "\n",
      "This project will provide the following benefits to the client:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A more scalable and reliable AI Phone Agent, as Fireworks.ai is a more powerful language model than OpenAI.\n",
      "* A faster and more efficient AI Phone Agent, as Fireworks.ai is a newer language model than OpenAI.\n",
      "* A more cost-effective AI Phone Agent, as Fireworks.ai is a more affordable language model than OpenAI.\n",
