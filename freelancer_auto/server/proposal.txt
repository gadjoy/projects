**Project Summary**

We propose to develop a Python application that will be deployed to Microsoft Azure. The application will be used to streamline various CORS configurations and ensure consistent and improved functionality across the platform.

**Project Understanding**

We have carefully analyzed your requirements and developed a clear project description that provides a solid foundation for the development of this application. We have also proactively outlined the project's scope and objectives, which demonstrates our commitment and focus.

**Solution Fit**

Our solution design meets your requirements by providing a top-level explanation of how the application will streamline CORS configurations and ensure consistent and improved functionality across the platform. This design establishes a focus on quality and alignment with your goals.

**Client-Centric Value**

Our project outline provides clarity to ensure that the application evolves in accordance with your vision. We are committed to your feedback and invite you to further refine project goals as a collaborative effort.

**Invitation to Collaboration**

We would like to discuss a formal development plan with you in order to further refine the project scope and objectives. We believe that this collaboration will be mutually beneficial and will result in a successful project.

**Call to Action**

We would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the development of this application in more detail. Please contact us at [email protected] to set up a time to chat.

**Outcome**

We would like to develop a proof-of-concept (POC) that demonstrates our ability to successfully complete this project. The POC will include a SRS, architecture, workflows, message sequence charts, and UI wireframes. The POC will be completed within 4 weeks and will be presented to you at the end of that time.
