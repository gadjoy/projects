- Truncate a video file that is stored in s3 bucket using mediaconvert and upload the new truncated file (of 5 seconds) in the same bucket.
- Transcoding a truncated video file that's currently stored in S3
- The final output with possible combinations should get stored in another s3 bucket. The script should be capable enough to check if the output file is already present in the destination bucket (for any possible combination), it should not create a new output file for that combination.

- Experience with AWS's S3 and Mediaconvert.
- Highly Proficient in Python
- Prior experience in video transcoding especially into AV1, AVC (H.264), and HEVC (H.265) formats.
