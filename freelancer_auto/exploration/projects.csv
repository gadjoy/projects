On Monday we are currently creating boards that we call masters in which we enter all the data. We want that when an item is created in this board it will also be created in an other daughter boards. What we have been able to do with what monday gives us is an automation that when an item is created in the master board it is also created in the daughter boards. In addition, the data in the daughter boards are linked to the master one via mirror type columns, so that we have the updated data in all the boards. However, there are some features missing in this connection.

The functions we need are:
- automatically create subitems in a daughter board. This functionality exists for items but is not available for subitems
- create mirror columns to subitems. Currently it is only possible to link mirror columns to items and not to subitems, we need this so that we can update subitems from one place so that they are synchronized. In case it is not possible to change the column type we can use a support board for this function, where we create all the items that will become subitems in the master board, so we can link them with the mirror column.
- Move the created item into a group. At the moment when an item is automatically created in the child board it is placed in the first group of the board, we would like it instead to be placed in a group with the same name as the status assigned to it

* The expertise of an experienced Python developer with a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology.

* Development of a Python-based trading bot for the Solana blockchain platform. This bot should be capable of autonomous trading and have risk management features integrated.

* The bot needs to implement Quantitative strategies algorithms and be automated, lending to your experience with these or similar algorithms would be highly advantageous.

* A deep understanding of trading strategies is essential for this position. The trading strategy and its metabolism should be in direct interaction with the blockchain, not through exchanges like Coinbase Pro or Kraken.

* An additional requirement is an understanding of integrating the developed product in an environment that is primarily dealing with the Solana blockchain platform.

*  * Anti-Rug features, Rug Protection to prevent dev liquidity pulls and if contract is a Rug then bot can detect before liquidity is pulled by devs and frontrun sell and exit position before rug is executed 

* Anti-bot Protection (Block delay, comprehensive contract open trading unlocks).

*  Liquidity detection: The bot is able to detect when the liquidity pool is created and be able to snipe trades immediately within seconds on the same block if possible. This will be the main function.

* Should scan contracts and filter out parameters in regards to rugs/scams like honeypots, if contract is freezable, liquidity not locked, has airdrops, mintable, liquidity exploits, dev exploits,  etc. and filter those out and automatically trigger good contracts and as soon as liquidity is added on those good contracts triggered then it should buy/snipe tokens immediately dealing directly with blockchain to ensure we are one of the first to snipe once liquidity is added. Need to be able to buy in whatever denomination i set that is editable by me at any point or it can trade based on wallet size. 

*  Filtering or AI processing is extremely important since 90% of newly launched tokens are scams so this function must be top tier.

*  Customized priority fee:
You can customize the priority fee in order to get transactions confirmed faster.

*  Telegram scrapping:
The bot can automatically pick the Token address from DMs and channels/groups both public or private. It also supports links.

*  WSOL Sniping:
Snipe using WSOL instead of normal SOL to accelerate your snipes. Wrap and unwrap WSOL from the same interface.

*  Take profit / Stop loss / Trailing / Timers:
Automate the selling based on multiple strategies which i can customize and select at any given time. Will need to also be able to execute via keyboard or phone  to force sell or change settings 

*  Latency checks:
Test the latency of any node with a simple ping test.

*  Text filters:
When scrapping a telegram group define text filters to choose which tokens to snipe.

*  Sniping:
Ability to snipe any token as soon as liquidity is added. Be the first to buy any coin.
Supported pools should be Raydium AMM, Jupiter, ORCA, Raydium CLMM, Flux.

*  Should be computer and mobile friendly so that I may use on my computer or Mobile device.

*  Be able to Maximize profits by exploiting positive arbitrage opportunities. Also the ability to frontrun and execute sandwiching attacks if need be. 

*  MEV Protection: 
Ability to send transactions privately and avoid getting frontrun

*  Also need ability to completely control access to the bot. So if I wish to give access to someone else for testing i can control timeframe they have access via license keys that can be auto generated and expire after any timeframe that I set. Either they can link their personal Solana wallet or have a feature where wallet can be generated. 

It would help the progress of this project immensely if you are already familiar with the underlying technology of the Solana Blockchain, and python-based trading bots. This might be a challenging project, but it's an exciting one that could potentially redefine trading strategies in the blockchain space."
