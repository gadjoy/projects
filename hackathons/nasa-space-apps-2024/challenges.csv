With GIS and other mapping technologies, you can create a map of an area and layer open data over it spatially to reveal new, enriching insights. Your challenge is to create a map that incorporates open science data to explore how an issue in your community is shaped by the surrounding physical geography. Maybe you’re concerned about food deserts and want to analyze the locations of grocery stores in your neighborhood? Or perhaps you’d like to explore the impacts of pollution on the local water supply? There’s so much space for opportunity—all you have to do is map it!"
Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects,https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges//nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/create-an-orrery-web-app-that-displays-near-earth-objects/,"Intermediate, Advanced","Astrophysics, Games, Planets & Moons, Software, Space Exploration","Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, such models have been referred to as orreries. The first orreries were physical models, but today we can use numerous tools to create virtual orreries that have many more features than their ancient mechanical counterparts. Your challenge is to create an interactive orrery web app that is embedded in a webpage and displays celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids."

Exosky!,https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges//nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/exosky/,"Intermediate, Advanced","Astrophysics, Planets & Moons, Software","What would the night sky look like if you were standing on one of the many exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions? The list of 5500+ exoplanets at the NASA Exoplanet Archive can be combined with the latest star catalogs to translate the location and brightness of millions or even billions of stars to another perspective. From that perspective, anyone could use their imagination to draw constellations, much like our ancestors did on Earth thousands of years ago. Your challenge is to develop an app or interface for students that allows them to choose an exoplanet and then either display an interactive star chart or export a high-quality image for printing or viewing on a computer or virtual reality display, where they can draw and name constellations."

Your challenge is to create a game that integrates Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program protocols to help players understand the world around them, develop awareness of one or more local or global environmental topics (e.g., urbanization, water pollution, drought, heat waves, flooding), investigate their local community using GLOBE protocols, or learn scientific principles."
Imagine our Connected Earth,https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges//nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/imagine-our-connected-earth/,"Intermediate, Advanced","Arts, Climate, Earth, Software","Our Earth systems are intricately connected on a global scale. For example, climate change can increase the length and severity of droughts, which can make wildfires more prevalent, which can not only lead to poor air quality from smoke, but can also influence ecological succession and forest regeneration. The Earth Information Center works to communicate examples of these interconnections to the public via physical exhibits and an online platform, but new ideas on how to communicate this important message to the public are always welcome! Your challenge is to devise an audio-visual interactive product (e.g., an animation, video, web-based immersive experience, musical application, etc.) that incorporates imagery and data from NASA’s fleet of Earth observing satellites to highlight and explore the interconnections between Earth’s systems, and demonstrate how changes in one system can alter another system."
Landsat Reflectance Data: On the Fly and at Your Fingertips,https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges//nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/landsat-reflectance-data-on-the-fly-and-at-your-fingertips/,"Intermediate, Advanced","Earth, Software","Landsat missions have provided the longest continuous dataset of remotely sensed measurements of Earth’s land surface. Comparing ground-based spectral measurements with Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data collected at the same time can facilitate experiential learning, encourage scientific exploration with satellite data, foster interdisciplinary and spatial thinking skills, and empower individuals to become informed global citizens. But to compare ground-based measurements with Landsat data, you need to know when Landsat will be passing over a specific land area, and then be able to access the Landsat data collected at that place and time.  Your challenge is to develop a web-based application that supports the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data by allowing users to define a target location, receive notifications when Landsat is to pass over that location, and then access and display the corresponding Landsat SR data."

But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!"
