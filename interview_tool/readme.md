## Description

This project is a Vue.js/Python application designed to assist with preparing for interviews. 

It includes a transcription service and a content generation API.

This project is a Vue.js application that transcribes audio and sends the transcribed text to an API endpoint. The API returns feedback, which is then displayed in the application.
