# RailwayApp Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying RailwayApp on the Railway platform, including configuration changes for custom port settings and the addition of a `start.sh` script.

## 1. Project Setup

1. **Sign Up**: Register an account on Railway at [railway.app](https://railway.app/).
2. **Install Railway CLI**: Install the Railway CLI globally on your machine via npm: `npm install -g railway`.
3. **Create a New Project**: Use the Railway CLI to initialize a new project: `railway init`. Follow the prompts to create and link your local project to the Railway platform.

## 2. Code Configuration

1. **Port Configuration**:
    - Update your Python backend code to read the port number from an environment variable. Use `os.environ.get('PORT')` to dynamically assign the port. Example:
        ```python
        import os
        from flask import Flask

        app = Flask(__name__)

        port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run(debug=True, port=port)
        ```

2. **start.sh Script**:
    - Create a `start.sh` script in the root directory of your project. This script should contain the necessary commands to start your backend server. Example:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        export PORT=3000  # Set the desired port number
        python app.py  # Replace with your actual start command
        ```

## 3. Deployment

1. **Git Integration**: Commit your code changes including the updated port configuration and the `start.sh` script to your local Git repository.
2. **Deployment Configuration**: In Railway's dashboard or using the Railway CLI, specify the `start.sh` script as your start command (`./start.sh`) and configure the desired deployment branch and environment variables.
3. **Trigger Deployment**: Initiate the deployment process either through Railway's dashboard or by running `railway deploy` in your terminal.

## 4. Testing & Monitoring

- Set up testing and monitoring for your RailwayApp following best practices. Ensure to consider the changes made regarding port configuration and the `start.sh` script.

## 5. Documentation

- Update your deployment guide and project documentation to include instructions for configuring custom ports and using the `start.sh` script during deployment with Python. Provide clear guidance on how to set up environment variables, modify the `start.sh` script if necessary, and trigger deployments with these changes.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

- Continuously gather feedback and iterate on your deployment process to optimize performance, reliability, and ease of deployment for RailwayApp.
