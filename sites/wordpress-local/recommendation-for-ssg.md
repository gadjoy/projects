I understand you want complete independence from third-party hosting services. Here are the best static site generators that give you full control and can be hosted anywhere:

1. **Hugo** (Written in Go)
   - **Advantages**:
     - Extremely fast build times
     - Single binary, no dependencies
     - Great for image-heavy sites
     - Simple deployment
   - **Features**:
     - Built-in image processing
     - Native gallery support
     - No runtime dependencies
     - Can be hosted on any web server

2. **11ty (Eleventy)** (JavaScript-based)
   - **Advantages**:
     - Zero client-side JavaScript by default
     - Flexible with multiple template languages
     - Easy to understand for developers
   - **Features**:
     - Works with plain HTML/CSS
     - Great performance
     - Simple build process

3. **Jekyll** (Ruby-based)
   - **Advantages**:
     - Mature ecosystem
     - Simple structure
     - Great documentation
   - **Features**:
     - Built-in blog support
     - Large theme ecosystem
     - Easy content management

4. **Astro** (Modern JavaScript)
   - **Advantages**:

     - Component-based architecture
     - Excellent image optimization
   - **Features**:
     - Built-in asset optimization
     - Multiple framework support
     - Great for image galleries

For your art gallery site, I would specifically recommend **Hugo** because:
1. Single binary deployment
2. Excellent image handling
3. Fast build times
4. Can be hosted on any basic web server
5. No runtime dependencies
6. Built-in image processing and gallery features

Hosting Options for Complete Control:
1. **Basic Web Server**:
   - Apache
   - Nginx
   - Any standard web hosting that serves static files

2. **VPS Providers** (Minimal Cost):
   - DigitalOcean ($5/month)
   - Linode ($5/month)
   - Vultr ($3.50/month)

3. **Self-Hosted Options**:
   - Any web server that can serve static files
   - Can run on minimal hardware

Would you like me to:
1. Create a starter Hugo template for your art gallery?
2. Show you how to migrate your WordPress content to Hugo?
3. Set up a basic Nginx configuration for hosting?

Here's a basic example of how the Hugo structure would look:

```
artbypriti/
├── config.toml
├── content/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── gallery/
│       ├── collection1/
│       │   ├── _index.md
│       │   └── artwork1.md
│       └── collection2/
│           ├── _index.md
│           └── artwork2.md
├── layouts/
│   ├── _default/
│   │   ├── baseof.html
│   │   └── single.html
│   └── gallery/
│       ├── list.html
│       └── single.html
├── static/
│   └── images/
└── themes/
    └── gallery-theme/
```

The advantages of this approach:
1. Complete control over hosting
2. No vendor lock-in
3. Minimal server requirements
4. Fast load times
5. Lower hosting costs
6. Better security (smaller attack surface)

Let me know which aspect you'd like to explore first, and I'll help you get started with the migration!
