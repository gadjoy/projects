Yes, absolutely! You can host Hugo sites directly on GitHub Pages for free using GitHub Actions for automated deployment. This is an excellent choice because:

1. **Completely Free Hosting**:
   - GitHub Pages hosting is free for public repositories
   - Includes free SSL certificate
   - Custom domain support
   - Global CDN through GitHub's infrastructure

2. **Automated Workflow**:
   - Push to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
   - No manual intervention needed

Here's how we can set it up:

1. **Repository Structure**:
```
artbypriti/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── hugo.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow
├── content/             # Your content (markdown files)
├── static/             # Images and other static files
├── themes/             # Hugo theme
├── config.toml         # Hugo configuration
└── README.md
```

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/hugo.yml`):
```yaml
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          extended: true
      - name: Build with Hugo
        run: hugo --minify
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./public

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v3
```

3. **Workflow**:
   - Create content in markdown files
   - Add images to the `static` folder
   - Push to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys

4. **Benefits**:
   - Zero hosting costs
   - Just pay for domain name (optional)
   - Automatic SSL
   - Version control for content
   - Easy collaboration
   - Built-in backup

Would you like me to:
1. Create a starter Hugo template for your art gallery with GitHub Actions setup?
2. Show you how to migrate your WordPress content to this structure?
3. Set up image optimization workflow for your gallery?

The migration process would be:
1. Export WordPress content
2. Convert to Hugo's markdown format
3. Set up GitHub repository
4. Configure GitHub Actions
5. Set up custom domain (optional)

For image handling, we can:
1. Use Hugo's built-in image processing
2. Implement lazy loading
3. Create responsive images
4. Optimize for web delivery

Let me know which aspect you'd like to start with, and I'll help you set it up!

Note: GitHub Pages has a soft limit of about 1GB for repositories, but this is usually plenty for a gallery site with optimized images. If you need more space, we can also look at Git LFS (Large File Storage) or implement a hybrid approach with image hosting on a service like Cloudinary's free tier while keeping the site on GitHub Pages.
