I'll help you deploy your Hugo site to GitHub Pages and connect it with your domain. I'll break this down into steps:

1. First, let me check if you already have a GitHub workflow set up for deployment.

Ran tool
I see you don't have GitHub workflows set up yet. Here's what we need to do to deploy your Hugo site:

1. First, let's create a GitHub workflow for automated deployment. I'll create this for you:


Now that we have the workflow file set up, here are the steps you need to follow to deploy your site:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (if you haven't already)
   - Name it `artbypriti` or whatever you prefer
   - Make it public

2. **Initialize and Push Your Code**:
   Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
After initializing the repository, let's connect it to GitHub. You'll need to:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `artbypriti` or whatever you prefer
2. Then run these commands to connect and push your code:

```bash
git branch -M main && git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/artbypriti.git
```
Now, let's check your Hugo configuration to ensure it's set up correctly for GitHub Pages deployment:

Read file: hugo.toml
I'll update the Hugo configuration to use your GitHub Pages URL:


Now that we have everything set up, here are the steps to complete the deployment:

1. Replace `YourUsername` in both:
   - The git remote command above
   - The `baseURL` in `hugo.toml`
   with your actual GitHub username

2. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

3. On GitHub:
   - Go to your repository's Settings
   - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow we created will automatically build and deploy your site

4. To connect your custom domain:
   - In your repository's Settings
   - Go to "Pages" section
   - Under "Custom domain", enter your domain name
   - Click "Save"
   - Add/update these DNS records at your domain registrar:
     ```
     Type  Name              Value
     A     @                 185.199.108.153
     A     @                 185.199.109.153
     A     @                 185.199.110.153
     A     @                 185.199.111.153
     CNAME www              yourusername.github.io
     ```

5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)

Your site will be available at both:
- `https://yourusername.github.io/artbypriti/`
- Your custom domain (once DNS propagation is complete)

The GitHub Actions workflow we created will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to the main branch.

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps or explain anything in more detail?
