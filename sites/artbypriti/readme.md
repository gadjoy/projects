## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- **Theme**: [Gallery Theme](https://github.com/nicokaiser/hugo-theme-gallery/)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (version 0.123.0 or later)
2. Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/artbypriti.git
   cd artbypriti
   ```

2. Start the Hugo development server:
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```

3. View the site at: `http://localhost:1313/`

## 📝 Content Management

The site content is now organized in a flat structure for easier management:

```
content/
├── about/
├── apple-with-dots/
├── banana/
├── dragon-fruit/
├── ... (other artwork folders)
```

- Each artwork is stored in its own directory directly under `content/` (except for `about/`).
- Each artwork folder contains:
  - `index.md`: Metadata, description, and front matter (including the `categories` field for Hugo taxonomy)
  - Image files in various resolutions
- The `categories` field in the front matter is used by Hugo's taxonomy system to group and display artworks by category.

**Note:** The previous nested category folders (e.g., `acrylic-on-canvas/`, `oil-on-canvas/`) have been removed in favor of this flat structure. Category pages are still available via Hugo taxonomy, but the `/categories/` index page is hidden for a cleaner user experience.

## 🔄 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment workflow:

1. Builds the Hugo site
2. Minifies the output
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages
