Problem Statement -Skeleton of the T-Rex

Scope of work

- Build the T-Rex Model

Challenges -Assembly

Execution Strategy From tail to teeth, this carnivore is created exactly in the image of its ancestor. No details were spared, from its intricate skull to its delicate ribcage, to its laughably small arms.

Value Added -This lizard king is at home in the classroom as well as in a dienophile's collection. Simple to print with PDF assembly instructions, T-Rex is a unique addition for all kinds of lesson plans and other fun uses.
