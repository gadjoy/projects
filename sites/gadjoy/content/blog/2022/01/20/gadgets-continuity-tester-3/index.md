Problem Statement -To test continuity

Scope of work

- &nbsp; Testing continuity in wires.

Challenges

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no place to remove and solder the tip of the tester.

Execution Strategy -We attached wire using heat shrink tube so that it should not come out while testing. -3D - Printed -PLA Filament

Value Added -This same continuity tester can be used while doing mini projects like to test continuity in boards etc..
