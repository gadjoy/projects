Problem Statement -Filament guider for 3D printer PLA -Scope of work

- Printing the filament guider in standard size

Challenges

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing the support filament from the hollow portion

Execution Strategy -Use the correct filing tool

Value Added - Its only a 10-15 min print but so helpful if you want to guide your filament. Just put a standard sized 1.75mm Capricorn tube in and it holds perfectly.
