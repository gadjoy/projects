Problem Statement -Ender 3 Cover LCD PCB with Drawer -Scope of work

- Print a holder for the ender 3, LCD PCB display

Challenges

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Printing the whole part without the support and with correct dimensions

Execution Strategy -The size and support was edited before printing

Value Added -A Cover/Case I made for the PCB on the back of the LCD screen of the&nbsp;Ender 3&nbsp;Printer. It has a Drawer underneath to store 4 Mini-SD cards + accessories, like USB sticks and such.
