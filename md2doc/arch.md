### 1. High-Level Architecture (Block Diagram)
![High-Level Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/500x300.png?text=High-Level+Architecture+Diagram)

**Components**:
- **Frontend**: Streamlit Web App
  - **Technology**: Streamlit (Python framework), HTML5, CSS3 for styling.
  - **Role**: Handles user inputs and displays optimized routes and schedules.
- **Backend**: Python-based Application Server
  - **Technology**: Flask (Python framework), used for integrating business logic and handling API requests.
  - **Role**: Manages data processing, route optimization logic, and interactions with external APIs.
- **Database**: MySQL
  - **Technology**: MySQL for structured storage of location and route data.
  - **Role**: Stores user input data and optimized route results persistently.
- **External Integrations**:
  - **Google Maps API**: For fetching travel times and distances.
  - **Role**: Critical for calculating travel durations between locations.

**Data Flow**:
- User inputs data in the frontend which sends it to the backend.
- Backend processes this data, interacts with the Google Maps API, and performs route optimization.
- Results are stored in the database and sent back to the frontend for display.

### 2. Workflow Design (Flowchart)
![Workflow Design](https://via.placeholder.com/500x300.png?text=Workflow+Design+Flowchart)

**Key Steps**:
- Start: User logs into the web application.
- Input data upload: User uploads location data and sets time constraints.
- Data validation: Backend validates the data.
- Fetch travel times: Calls Google Maps API for travel data.
- Optimize route: Backend processes optimization algorithm.
- Save results: Store optimized routes in database.
- Display results: Show the route and schedule on the frontend.
- End.

**Branches for Error Handling**:
- Invalid data input.
- API failure or timeout.
- Database write failure.

### 3. Message Sequence Chart (MSC)
![Message Sequence Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/500x300.png?text=Message+Sequence+Chart)

**Selected Interaction**: User requesting a route optimization.
- **Lifelines**: Frontend, Backend, Google Maps API, Database.
- **Key Messages**:
  - User sends optimization request.
  - Backend fetches travel times from Google Maps.
  - Backend performs optimization.
  - Results are saved and returned.

### 4. UI Wireframing (Optional)
Here, Iâ€™d include basic wireframes for the input screen and the results display, focusing on simplicity and usability to match the Streamlit environment.

### 5. Sample Code Snippet (Optional)
Python function to interact with Google Maps API:
```python
import requests

def fetch_travel_time(source, destination, api_key):
    """Fetch travel time between two coordinates using Google Maps API."""
    url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json"
    params = {
        'origins': f"{source[0]},{source[1]}",
        'destinations': f"{destination[0]},{destination[1]}",
        'key': api_key
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    return data['rows'][0]['elements'][0]['duration']['value']  # Duration in seconds

# Example usage
source = (40.712776, -74.005974)  # New York
destination = (34.052235, -118.243683)  # Los Angeles
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
travel_time = fetch_travel_time(source, destination, api_key)
print(f"Travel Time: {travel_time / 60} minutes")
```
This snippet includes a function to call the Google Maps API to retrieve travel time, which is critical for the route optimization process.

Each part of this documentation aims to clearly outline the system architecture, interactions, and critical workflows while addressing the core functionalities and requirements specified in the SRS.
