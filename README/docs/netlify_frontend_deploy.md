# Deploying Your Frontend to Netlify

1. **Sign up for Netlify**: If you haven't already, sign up for a Netlify account at [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).

2. **Connect your Git repository**: Netlify can automatically deploy your site from a Git repository. Log in to your Netlify account and click on the "New site from Git" button.

3. **Authorize Git provider**: Netlify supports various Git providers such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Choose your preferred provider and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

4. **Select your repository**: After authorization, select the repository where your frontend code is hosted.

5. **Configure your build settings**:
   - **Branch to deploy**: Choose the branch you want Netlify to deploy from. Typically, this is the main branch like `master` or `main`.
   - **Build command**: Specify the command to build your frontend. For example, if you're using npm, this could be `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
   - **Publish directory**: Specify the directory where your built files are located. This is usually a directory like `build` or `dist`.

6. **Deploy your site**: Once you've configured your build settings, click the "Deploy site" button. Netlify will start the deployment process, which may take a few moments depending on the size of your project.

7. **Customize your domain (optional)**: Netlify provides a free subdomain for your site (e.g., `your-site-name.netlify.app`). If you have a custom domain, you can set it up in the "Domain settings" section of your site dashboard.

8. **Monitor your deployments**: You can monitor the progress of your deployments in the Netlify dashboard. Netlify will also notify you via email or other channels once the deployment is complete.

9. **Continuous deployment**: Netlify can automatically redeploy your site whenever you push changes to your Git repository. This ensures that your site is always up to date with the latest code.
